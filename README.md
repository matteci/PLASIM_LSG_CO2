PLASIM - LSG (Large deviation & hysteresis)
======

*General Circulation Models Planet Simulator (PlaSim)*
(Streamlined fork of https://github.com/HartmutBorth/PLASIM)

This repository has all necessary components to run the model.

This version of the model contains some improvements compared to [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/101884206.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/101884206) [Used in PLASIM_LD repo]

Main improevements concerns output variables in LSG and are explained in [Link to Sauer's repositry]

This model is a research model used in Meteorology and Earth Sciences.
You need knowledge in Meteorology, Climatology and skills in Linux, C and FORTRAN
for running the model and interpreting the results.

Please start reading the manual located in:
plasim/doc for the Planet Simulator
Then have a look at the README file for configuration and setup.
